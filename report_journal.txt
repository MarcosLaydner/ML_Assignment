after counting, aproxmentely 56% of data is false, so that is our baseline acc

after initial tests with the three models that give results close to the baseline acc,
feature selection must be done to improve the model.

Considering the first alteration was removing F20, my first ideia was to include it back,
using the avg value of the present value to substitue missing entries.

after including F20, there was a slight improvement

The next step was experimenting with back elimination, removing features and seeing what removal resulted in better
performance.
